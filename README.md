## I'm Learning Python Methods and Functions

These things are what I am thinking of when I say that the romantics -- Keats in particular -- would have been software developers if they were alive today. Poetry was William Blake's Python algorithms. It's a double-edged sword that they were unable to do Udemy coding courses in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. We wouldn't have the romantic movement's poetry, but we would have their likely equally brilliant creative output in terms of algorithms and code. Can you imagine the machine learning version of Percy Bysshe Shelley's Ozymandias?

Anyway, I'm 30% completed with Jose Portilla's Python intro course, so I need to get my head out of the clouds and get back into action. Thank you for reading this note to posterity that you left for yourself.
