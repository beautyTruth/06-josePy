## I'm Learning Python Methods and Functions

These things are what I am thinking of when I say that the romantics -- Keats in particular -- would have been software developers if they were alive today. Poetry was William Blake's Python algorithms. It's a double-edged sword that they were unable to do Udemy coding courses in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. We wouldn't have the romantic movement's poetry, but we would have their likely equally brilliant creative output in terms of algorithms and code. Can you imagine the machine learning version of Percy Bysshe Shelley's Ozymandias?

Anyway, I'm 30% completed with Jose Portilla's Python intro course, so I need to get my head out of the clouds and get back into action. Thank you for reading this note to posterity that you left for yourself.

UPDATE:

The above references the 21st of July, 2023 if that is not clear from the date and time of the first commit, future self.

I started Saturday the 22nd with a successful coding quiz in this course. This stuff is somehow sticking in my 48.5-year-old brain. My grey matter has been abused, but somehow there is enough left to be functionally elastic and spongy. Maybe it's because I do a good Spongebob Squarepants impersonation. Maybe it's because I take a multivitamin. Maybe it's because I am listening to the Spa playlist on Apple Music Wellbeing while I learn. I listen to the Meditation playlist when I meditate and that has been successful. So far, so good.

Now it's time to learn \*args and \*\*kwargs.

Update from July 23rd: I'm pumping the brakes on my enterprise a little bit in order to enable a more solid foundation. I've been going through Jose's course as directed, but I think I'm going to hang around and repeat the function exercises and homework for what willl amout to four or five solid hours of repeat learning. My concrete needs to cure a lot more before I can confidently say that I am "all good" with Python functions before moving on to areas of study and application that actually require me to write them from scratch -- like machine learning and data science! I'm also curbing my enthusiasm and limiting myself to a little over an hour of coding today, Sunday, which is a weekend day in western society, so that I can maintain my hunger for learning throughout the workweek which are days of work in western society. I've found that when I get super in to something that I develop a sort of a malaise when I force myself to do it. However, the opposite is true when I force myself to _not_ do it. I develop an appetite for more when I hold back. I've just completed the Find_77 exercise and I'm starting to feel confident in my abilities to manipulate lists. Thoughts of doing these sorts of things in Python are populating my thoughts as I walk -- an effect that, if past experience proves correct, means that I am going to be super in to this for a while.
