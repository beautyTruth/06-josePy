## I'm Learning Python Methods and Functions

These things are what I am thinking of when I say that the romantics -- Keats in particular -- would have been software developers if they were alive today. Poetry was William Blake's Python algorithms. It's a double-edged sword that they were unable to do Udemy coding courses in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. We wouldn't have the romantic movement's poetry, but we would have their likely equally brilliant creative output in terms of algorithms and code. Can you imagine the machine learning version of Percy Bysshe Shelley's Ozymandias?

Anyway, I'm 30% completed with Jose Portilla's Python intro course, so I need to get my head out of the clouds and get back into action. Thank you for reading this note to posterity that you left for yourself.

UPDATE:

The above references the 21st of July, 2023 if that is not clear from the date and time of the first commit, future self.

I started Saturday the 22nd with a successful coding quiz in this course. This stuff is somehow sticking in my 48.5-year-old brain. My grey matter has been abused, but somehow there is enough left to be functionally elastic and spongy. Maybe it's because I do a good Spongebob Squarepants impersonation. Maybe it's because I take a multivitamin. Maybe it's because I am listening to the Spa playlist on Apple Music Wellbeing while I learn. I listen to the Meditation playlist when I meditate and that has been successful. So far, so good.

Now it's time to learn \*args and \*\*kwargs.
